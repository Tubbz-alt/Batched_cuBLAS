To fully exploit the computational power of the GPU generally a large amount of data parallelism must be expressed. In the specific case of accelerated libraries such as <code>cuBLAS</code>, <code>cuFFT</code>, and <code>cuSPARSE</code> if each operation does not possess a <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/support/system-user-guides/accelerated-computing-guide/#3093">sufficient</a> amount of data parallelism another option is to batch many smaller operations into a single large operation. This tutorial will demonstrate how to take advantage of batched <code>cuBLAS</code> operations to improve GPU utilization. Additionally this tutorial will expand on the <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/tutorials/concurrent-kernels/">GPU concurrency </a> topics from the first tutorial through the use of <code>streams</code> and <code>Hyper-Q</code>.
